# Contributing

This documentation can be read by people who are not familiar with django or python (like frontend developers). However, if you want to understand the core of this project in detail, you should know python and django well.

If you are in frontend development, it'll be good if you learn a bit about django's templating system (but it's okay if you don't).

First of all, you must run the website locally and explore it. You can contribute only after you know what this project is about and what in it that needs fixing/improvement.

## What you should read first

Read about the models used in this project. (models.md)

Read about the scripts at your disposal. (scripts.md)

## Ways to contribute

1. If you are good at HTML/CSS/JS, you can help in making webpages interactive and better-looking.
2. If you are good at python and django, you can help with backend development. That's what I'll be doing mostly.
3. If you are good at photoshop, you can design a good logo for this project. Also the project's name has not been finalized. You can suggest a new name.
4. If you know unit-testing and python, you can write tests for model methods, views, scripts, etc.
5. If you are well-versed with django-registration or something similar, replace the accounts app with that.

## Other ways of contributing

1. You can help in improving this documentation itself.
2. If you identify any issue, report it as an issue on the project's github issues page. Try and include ways to replicate the bug.
3. Try building this project on Windows. I haven't done it yet. Send me feedback if you do so.
4. Though I believe in sticking to python3, if you really want this project to be compatible with python2, find out any incompatibilities and their solution and tell me about them.
